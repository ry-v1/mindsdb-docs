## Processed Dataset 

###### [![Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/GET--DATA-TelecomCustomerChurn-green)](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb-examples/tree/master/classics/customer_churn/raw_data)

Customer churn or customer turnover is the loss of clients or customers. Telecommunication companies often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.  Use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


def run():

    mdb = mindsdb.Predictor(name='employee_retention_model')

    mdb.learn(from_data='dataset/train.csv', to_predict='Churn')

    test_df = pd.read_csv('dataset/test.csv')
    predictions = mdb.predict(when_data='dataset/test.csv')

    predicted_val = [x.explanation['Churn']['predicted_value'] for x in predictions]

    real_val = list(map(str, list(test_df['Churn'])))

    accuracy = accuracy_score(real_val, predicted_val)

    #show additional info for each transaction row
    additional_info = [x.explanation for x in predictions]
