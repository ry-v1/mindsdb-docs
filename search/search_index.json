We are building MindsDB, because we want to Democratize Machine Learning . If you want to learn more about why this is important and how we aim to do this, you can check out our presentation here . Who are we building MindsDB for? We are building MindsDB for all of those that can get their hands in data. and can type a few lines of code. What are MindsDB's current Goals? MindsDB has 3 simple goals. Provide a way to learn and predict from data with a line of code. Explainable, by answering the following questions: When learning: What is interesting in my data and why? When can I trust this model and why? When I should not trust this model and why? How can I improve this model? When predicting: Why this prediction? Why not something else? Remain state of the art. Since MindsDB users are delegating the ML machinery, MindsDB should try to always generate state of the art models for the users. What is the roadmap? MindsDB roadmap is aimed to be aligned with our goals: Success versions 1.0 MindsDB GUI where you can visualize explainability goals Support for images and complex text MindsDB REST API's Success versions 2.0 Run Machine Learning Models as Tables Important versions 3.0 Auto ETL and Data Preparation What type of data can MindsDB learn and predict from? We support tabular data, this is CSV, Excel, JSON, text files, pandas data frame, URLs, s3 files or MySQL, Mongo, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL data stores. For more information please see the data sources documentation . How does it work? In very simple terms, MindsDB follows the following steps: to learn : break data source intro train, test, validate transform data source into tensors build and train encoders (if necessary) produce a neural network based model that can take in the input tensor and produce the target tensor break train data into batches and try learning a model that can fit the target test and validate until model convergence store metadata about the most fit model to predict : transform question data into input tensor load most fit model run input tensor into model transform output tensor into readable output You can learn more about the internals of mindsdb here . How can I help? You can help in the following ways: Trying MindsDB and reporting issues . If you know python, you can also help us debug open issues. Issues labels with the good first issue tag should be the easiest to start with . You can help us with documentation and examples. Tell your friends, write a blog post about MindsDB.

(We will describe in more detail some of the Phase Modules in the next section). The MindsDB Stack DataExtractor It deals with extracting inputs from various data-sources such as files, directories and SQL compatible databases. If input is a query, it builds the joins with all implied tables (if any). StatsLoader : There is some transaction such as PREDICT where it's assumed that the statistical information is already known, all we have to do is make sure we load the right statistics to the transaction BUS. At the moment we don't support loading database from {char}svs that don't have headers or have incomplete headers. NOTE : That as of now mindsDB requires that the full dataset can be loaded into memory, in the future we might look into supporting very large datasets using something like apache drill to query a FS or db for the chunks of data we need in order to train and generate our statistical analysis . StatsGenerator Once the data is pulled and aggregated from the various data sources, MindsDB runs an analysis of each of the columns of the corpus. The purpose of the stats generator is two fold: To provide various data quality scores in order to determine the overall quality of a column (e.g. variance, some correlation metrics between columns, amount of duplicates). To provide properties about the columns which have to be used in the following steps and in order to rain the model. (e.g. histogram, data type) After all stats are computed, we warn the user of any interesting insights we found about his data and (if web logs are enabled), use the generated values to plot some interesting information about the data (e.g. data type distribution, outliers, histogram). Finally, the various stats are passed on as part of the metadata, so that further phases and the model itself can use them. Model Interface Train mode : When calling learn ,the model interface will feed the data to a machine learning framework which does the training in order to build a model. Preidct mode : When calling predict , the model interface will feed the data to the model built by learn in order to generate a prediction. Data adaption : The ModelInterface phase is simply a lighteight wrapper over the model backends which handle adapting the data frame used by mindsdb into a format they can work with. During this process additional metadata for the machine learning libraries/frameworks is generated based on the results of the Stats Generator phase. Learning backend : The learning backends as the ensemble learning libraries used by mindsdb to train the model that will generate the predictions. Currently the two learning backends we are working on supporting are Ludwig (maintained mainly by Uber, fully supported) and Lightwood (created by us, based on the pre 1.0 version of mindsdb, work in progress). ModelAnalyzer The model analyzer phase runs after training is done in order to gather insights about the model and gather insights about the data that we can only get post-training. At the moment, it contains the fitting for a probabilistic model which is used to determine the accuracy of future prediction, based on the number of missing features and the bucket in which the predicted value falls.","title":"Inside MindsDB"},{"location":"InsideMindsDB/#the-mindsdb-stack","text":"","title":"The MindsDB Stack"},{"location":"InsideMindsDB/#dataextractor","text":"It deals with extracting inputs from various data-sources such as files, directories and SQL compatible databases.

Predictor Note: The Predictor in MindsDB's words means Machine Learning Model. Constructor predictor = Predictor(name='weather_forecast') Constructs a new mindsdb predictor name -- Required argument, the name of the predictor, used for saving the predictor, creating a new predictor with the same name as a previous one loads the data from the old predictor root_folder -- The directory (also known as folder) where the predictor information should be saved log_level -- The log level that the predictor should use, number from 0 to 50, with 0 meaning log everything and 50 meaning log only fatal errors: DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL = 10 INFO_LOG_LEVEL = 20 WARNING_LOG_LEVEL = 30 ERROR_LOG_LEVEL = 40 NO_LOGS_LOG_LEVEL = 50 Learn predictor.learn(from_data=a_data_source, to_predict='a_column') Teach the predictor to make predictions on a given dataset, extract information about the dataset and extract information about the resulting machine learning model making the predictions. This is the \"main\" functionality of mindsdb_native together with the \"predict\" method. from_data -- the data that you want to use for training, this can be either a file, a pandas data frame, a url or a mindsdb data source. to_predict -- The columns/keys to be predicted (aka the targets, output columns, target variables), can be either a string (when specifying a single column) or a list of strings (when specifying multiple columns). test_from_data -- Specify a different data source on which mindsdb should test the machine learning model, by default mindsdb_native takes testing and validation samples from your dataset to use during training and analysis, and only trains the predictive model on ~80% of the data. This might seem sub-optimal if you're not used to machine learning, but trust us, it allows us to have much better confidence in the model we give you. timeseries specific parameters : group_by, window_size, order_by -- For more information on how to use these, please see the advanced examples section dealing with timeseries . Please note, these are currently subject to change, though they will remain backwards compatible until v2.0. ignore_columns -- Ignore certain columns from your data entirely. stop_training_in_x_seconds -- Stop training the model after this amount of seconds, note, the full amount it takes for mindsdb_native to run might be up to twice the amount you specify in this value. Thought, usually, the model training constitutes ~70-90% of the total mindsdb_native runtime. stop_training_in_accuracy -- Deprecated argument, left for backwards compatibility, to be removed or revamped in v2.0, refrain from using, it has no effects. backend -- The machine learning backend to use in order to train the model. This can be a string equal to lightwood (default) or ludwig , this can also be a custom model object. rebuild_model -- Defaults to True , if this is set to False the model will be loaded and the model analysis and data analysis will be re-run, but a new model won't be trained. use_gpu -- Defaults to None (autodetect), set to True if you have a GPU and want to make sure it's used or to False if you want to train the model on the CPU, this will speed up model training a lot in most situations. Note, that the default learning backend (lightwood) only work with relatively new (2016+) GPUs. equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories -- When you have unbalanced target variable values, this will treat all of them as equally important when training the model. To see more information about this and an example, please see advanced section . output_categories_importance_dictionary -- A dictionary containing a number representing the importance for each (or some) values from the column to be predicted. An example of how his can be used (assume the column we are predicting is called is_true and takes two falues): {'is_true': {'True':0.6, 'False':1}} . The bigger the number (maximum value is one), the more important will it be for the model to predict that specific value correctly (usually at the cost of predicting other values correctly and getting more false positives for that value). advanced_args -- A dictionary of advanced arguments. Includes force_disable_cache , force_categorical_encoding , handle_foreign_keys , use_selfaware_model , deduplicate_data . sample_settings -- A dictionary of options for sampling from the dataset.

Models With libraries such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pytorch you must have the expertise to build models from scratch. Your models are also black boxes, you can't be sure how or why they work and you have to pre-process your data in a format that's suitable for the model and look for any errors in the data yourself. With Mindsdb anyone can build state of the art models without any machine learning knowledge. Mindsdb also provides data extraction, analyses your input data and analyses the resulting model to try and understand what makes it work and what types of situations it works best in. Data Preprocessing Building models require time for cleaning the data, normalizing the data, converting it into the format your library uses, determining the type of data in each column and a proper encoding for it Mindsdb can read data from csv, json, excel, file urls, s3 objects , dataframes and relational database tables or queries (currently there's native support for maraiadb, mysql and postgres), you just need to tell it which colum(s) it should predict. It will automatically process the data for you and give insights about the data. Code Samples We are going to use home_rentals.csv dataset for comparison purpose. Inside the dataset dir, you can find the dataset split into train and test data. Our goal is to predict the rental_price of the house given the information we have in home_rental.csv . We will look at doing this with Sklearn, Tensorflow, Ludwig and Mindsdb. Sklearn is a generic easy-to-use machine learning library. Tensorflow is the state of the art deep learning model building library from google. Ludwig is a library from Uber that aims to help people build machine learning models without knowledge of machine learning (similar to mindsdb) Building the model Now we will build the actual models to train on the training dataset and run some predictions on the testing dataset. For the purpose of this example, we'll build a simple linear regression with both Tensorflow and Sklearn, in order to keep the code to a minimum.

Lastly, Mindsdb Scout provides you with an easy way to visiualize more insights about the model. This can also be done by calling mdb.get_model_data('model_name') , but it's easier to use Mindsdb Scout to visualize the data, rather than looking at the raw json. Comparing Mindsdb accuracy with state-of-the-art models We have a few example datasets where we try to compare the accuracy obtained by Mindsdb with that of the best models we could find. It should be noted, Mindsdb accuracy doesn't always beat or match stat-of-the-art models, but the main goal of Mindsdb is to learn quickly, be very easy to use and be adaptable on any dataset. If you have the time and know-how to build a model that performs better than Mindsdb, but you still want the insights into the model and the data, as well as the pre-processing that Mindsdb provides, you can always plug in a custom machine learning model into Mindsdb. We are currently creating a new Benchmarks repository where you can find detailed list with up to date examples. Untill we release that you can check the old list of accuracy comparisons on our examples repo . Each directory containes different examples, datasets and README.md . To see the accuracies and the models, simply run mindsdb_acc.py to run mindsdb on the dataset. At some point we might keep a more easy to read list of these comparisons, but for now the results change to often and there are too many models to make this practical to maintain. We invite anyone with an interesting dataset and a well performing models to send it to us, or contribute to this repository, so that we can see how mindsdb stands up to it (or try it themselves and tell us the results they got).","title":"Comparison with other Libraries"},{"location":"comparisons/ComparsionWithOtherLibraries/#models","text":"With libraries such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, Pytorch you must have the expertise to build models from scratch.

If you have the time and know-how to build a model that performs better than Mindsdb, but you still want the insights into the model and the data, as well as the pre-processing that Mindsdb provides, you can always plug in a custom machine learning model into Mindsdb. We are currently creating a new Benchmarks repository where you can find detailed list with up to date examples. Untill we release that you can check the old list of accuracy comparisons on our examples repo . Each directory containes different examples, datasets and README.md . To see the accuracies and the models, simply run mindsdb_acc.py to run mindsdb on the dataset. At some point we might keep a more easy to read list of these comparisons, but for now the results change to often and there are too many models to make this practical to maintain.

AITables example AITables differ from normal tables in that they can generate predictions upon being queried and returning such predictions like if it was data that existed on the table. Simply put, an AI-Table allows you to use machine learning models as if they were normal database tables, in something that in plain SQL looks like this; SELECT < predicted_variable > FROM < ML_model > WHERE < conditions > To really sink in this idea, let us expand the concept through an example. The used car price example Imagine that you want to solve the problem of estimating the right price for a car on your website that has been selling used cars over the past 2 years. The data is persistend in your database inside a table called used_cars_data where you keep records of every car you have sold so far, storing information such as: price, transmission, mileage, fuel_type, road_tax, mpg (Miles Per Gallon) and engine_size. Since you have historical data, you know that you could use Machine Learning to solve this problem. Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply tell your database server to do and manage the Machine Learning parts for you? At MindsDB we think so too! And AI-Tables baked directly to your database are here to do exactly that. You can for instance with a single INSERT statement, create a machine learning model/predictor trained to predict \u2018price\u2019 using the data that lives in the table sold_cars and publish it as an AI-Table called 'used_cars_model'. INSERT INTO mindsdb . predictors ( name , predict , select_data_query ) VALUES ( 'used_cars_model' , 'price' , ' SELECT * FROM used_cars_data ); After that you can get price predictions by querying the generated 'used_cars_model' AI-Table, as follows: SELECT price , confidence FROM mindsdb . used_cars_model WHERE model = \"a6\" AND mileage = 36203 AND transmission = \"automatic\" AND fueltype = \"diesel\" AND mpg = \"64.2\" AND enginesize = 2 AND year = 2016 AND tax = 20 ; As you can see with AI-Tables, we are aiming to simplify Machine Learning mechanics to simple SQL queries, so that you can focus on the important part; which is to think about what predictions you need and what data you want your ML to learn from to make such predictions.

This document contains information on each of these scores, as well as an outline for how mindsdb computes and uses them. A score of zero is considered very bad, whilst a score of one is considered perfect. Data Quality Scores Value Distribution Score Warning if < 3 Reliability: Average The value distribution score represents how biased the data is towards a certain value. This score can indicate either biasing towards one specific value of a column or a large number of outliers. So it is a reliable quality indicator but we aren't always sure \u201cwhy\u201d that is (as in, it can fall into 2 buckets). Currently a warning based on this score indicates a value is present that's at least 5x times more than the mean. Duplicates Score Warning if < 6 and overall quality is low Reliability: Poor As it stands, duplicates score consists in the % of duplicate values / 100. So, it can range from 0 (no duplicates) to 1 (all the values have one or more duplicates). This score is always 0 if the data type is categorical or date. Since duplicates in those cases are to be expected. It\u2019s also not necessarily \u201cbad\u201d if this score is large, for example, a text column consisting of: [\u2018house\u2019, \u2018apartment\u2019, \u2018house\u2019, \u2018apartment\u2019, \u2018duplex\u2019, \u2018house\u2019, \u2018apartment\u2019, \u2018duplex\u2019], maybe not be interpreted as \u201ccategorical\u201d by our data type generator and will have a duplicate score of 1. Empty cells score Warning if < 8 Reliability: Good This score is computed as the % of empty values / 100. It\u2019s very reliable on its own, since empty values in a column are never a good sign. Data type distribution score Warning if > 7 Reliability: Average This score indicates the % of data that are not of the same data type as the principal column type / 100. Z Test based outlier score Warning if < 6 Reliability: Average This score indicates the % of data that are 3 STDs or more away from the mean. There are various types of data where this can be the case, but usually it might indicate the data has too much noise. Local outlier factor score Warning if < 4 Reliability: Average The data consistency score is mainly based upon the Data Type Distribution Score and the Empty Cells Score , the Duplicates Score is also taken into account if present but with a smaller (2x smaller) bias. Similarity score Warning if < 6 Reliability: Good (When high) This score is simply a matthews correlation applied between this column and all other column. The score * 100 is the number of values which are similar in the column that is most similar to the scored column. Derived scores Consistency score Warning if: > 0.2 Reliability: Average The data consistency score is mainly based upon the Data Type Distribution Score and the Empty Cells Score , the Duplicates Score is also taken into account if present but with a smaller (2x smaller) bias. Redundancy score Warning if < 5 Reliability: Average The value is based in equal part on the Similarity Score and the Correlation Score . Variability/Randomness score Warning if < 6 Reliability: Average The value is based in equal part on the Z Test based outliers score , the LOG based outlier score and the Value Distribution Score .

In some cases, you might want to predict more than one column of your data. In order for mindsdb to predict multiple columns, you simply need to change the to_predict argument from a string (denoting the name of the column) to an array containing the names of the columns you want to predict. In the following example, we've altered the real estate model to predict the location and neighborhood both, instead of the rental_price . Code example import mindsdb mdb = mindsdb . Predictor ( name = 'multilabel_real_estate_model' ) mdb . learn ( from_data = \"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv\" , to_predict = [ 'location' , 'neighborhood' ] # Array with the names of the columns we want to predict ) Multimedia inputs (images, audio and video) Currently, we only support images as inputs into models. We are working on support audio, you can check this issue to track the progress. Video input support is not yet planned. For any sort of media files, simply provide the full path to the file in the column. For example: [ { 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_1.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : True } ,{ 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_2.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : True } ,{ 'img' : '/mnt/data/img_3.jpg' 'is_bicycle' : False } ] Please provide the full path to a file on your local machine, not a url or the binary data from an image loaded up in a dataframe. Currently, the timeline on supporting multimedia output is still undecided, if you need that feature or want to implement, feel free to contact us. That being said, image outputs might actually work, we just haven't tested anything yet. Timeseries predictions What is a timeseries ? A timeseries is a document where rows are related to each other in a sequential way, such that the prediction of the value in the present row should take into account a number of previous rows. To build a timeseries model you need to call learn with timeseries specific arguments: Mandatory arguments order_by -- The column on which to order the rows being feed into the model (e.g. a timestamp) window_size -- The number of rows to \"look back\" into when making a prediction, after the rows are ordered by the order_by column and split into groups. This is an alias for window_size_samples , they are interchangeable. You can use window_size_seconds instead if you want to use a number of seconds passing on the order by column, rather than a fixed number (please note, this approach assumes the order by column is or can be converted internally into a unix timestamp) Optional arguments group_by -- The column based on which to group multiple unrelated entities present in your timeseries data. If your data is coming from multiple sources, this argument can be a differentiator between those sources (e.g a uuid for the source). Code example import mindsdb mdb = mindsdb . Predictor ( name = 'assembly_machines_model' ) mdb . learn ( from_data = 'assembly_machines_historical_data.tsv' , to_predict = 'chance_of_failure' # timeseries specific args , order_by = 'timestamp' # The time of this reading , window_size_seconds = 12000 # Use the last 1200 seconds of data to train for the prediction of a row, If you want a fixed nr of rows, use window_size_samples instead , group_by = 'machine_id' # Train the model as a timeseries for each individual machine ) results = mdb . predict ( when_data = 'assembly_machines_data.tsv' ) Other approaches to timeseries data Another way of approaching a timeseries prediction, if you don't want to use mindsdb's interface, is to simply include array's for the non-group-by values in your rows. For example, to train, you could use the following csv: X vlas , previous Y vlas , Y now [ 1 2 3 4 ],[ 1 4 9 ], 16 [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ],[ 4 , 9 , 16 ], 25 [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ],[ 9 , 16 , 25 ], 36 And your model would be fit to predict the Y now column for this csv: X vlas , previous Y vlas [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ][ 49 , 64 , 81 ] [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ][ 1089 , 1156 , 1225 ] Unbalanced dataset Given a dataset that is \"imbalanced\", the model being trained might not give the results you expect. For example, let's say you have the following dataset: data . csv x , is_power_of_9 1 , False 2 , False 3 , False 4 , False 5 , False 6 , False 7 , False 8 , False 9 , True 10 , False 11 , False . . . 81 , True 82 , False 83 , False 84 , False . . . 100 , False On which we want to predicted the aptly-named column is_power_of_9 . We have 2 occurrences of the output True and 98 occurrences of the False output. So a model could always predict False and it would have an accuracy of 98%, which is pretty decent, so unless there's a way for the model to learn those 2 instance of True without losing on accuracy, it might just decided 98% is the best possible model. However, let's say we really care about those True predictions being correct, or at least we want the model to consider them equally important, in that case we would call the learn function using the equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories argument set to true. This essentially means that a model with 50% accuracy, with 2 correct predictions for True (100%) and 48 for False (49%) is considered better than a model with 98% accuracy that only predictions False when mindsdb trains the model. We could call this as: predictior.learn(from_data='data.csv', equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories=True)","title":"Advanced Data types"},{"location":"tutorials/AdvancedExamples/#multiple-column-predictions","text":"","title":"Multiple column predictions"},{"location":"tutorials/AdvancedExamples/#what-is-a-multiple-column-prediction","text":"In some cases, you might want to predict more than one column of your data.
